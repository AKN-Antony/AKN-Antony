<!-- Introduction -->
## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Anthony Kamau**, a passionate learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. I embarked on this journey because I wanted to solve real-world problems with technology, and I am fascinated by how software can change lives.

💡 What inspires me most is **building solutions that empower people and open-source collaboration**.

🎯 **My mission** is to *become a full-stack developer who creates meaningful digital products* and that's why I'm particularly drawn to working on:
- AI tools and APIs.
