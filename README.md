## My Journey  

It all began with a simple question: *"How does the internet know what I'm searching for?"* That curiosity ignited my passion for technology. My first line of code - `print("Hello, World!")` - was the spark that started everything.  

Today, I'm actively developing my skills to transition from asking how things work to building systems that solve real problems. Every day brings new opportunities to:  
- Break down complex systems into understandable components  
- Write clean, efficient code that makes a difference  
- Collaborate with others to create meaningful solutions
